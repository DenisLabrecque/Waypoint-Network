# Waypoint Network
 
The idea of this is to create a waypoint chart as used in aeronautical charts.

Waypoints have randomly generated names, and the shortest path from one waypoint to the next can be found easily.

Eventually, I want implement this in Unity for navigation of aircraft. In the meantime, it's a console application for testing reasons.
